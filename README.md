# ðŸ¥‡About the project

**The car for rent project** is built to help people who want to rent a car to travel, picnic, or do whatever. As a
person who wants to rent a car, they just find the car they want and make a contract online with the owner of this car.

**The** **car for rent project** is written by PHP and MySQL from scratch in 3 weeks. With the instruction of **Mr. Bang
Dinh** and **Mr. Tinh Le**, this project becomes a mini MVC framework from the beginning with a lot of things that all
frameworks have such as Router, Controller, View, Model, Service, Repository, Middleware, Access control list, and
Validator. Besides that, this project integrates with the S3 service of AWS Cloud to store files or images.
